# Introduction
Understanding facial expressions is one of the key factors of social interactions and reading social cues. It is an important skill in communicating with others and being able to relate to those around you. While understanding facial expressions is not uniquely a skill only humans have, it is a sign of intelligence. In this application of artificial intelligence and classification techniques we try to identify expressions in facial images. We hope to be able to identify facial expressions by training our neural network to look for specific characteristics in an expression. For example to identify a “happy” expression we can train our neural network to look for features such as observation of teeth, dimples in the cheeks, and reduction in the size of the eyes. Through identification of a facial expression we can then classify the emotion of the person behind the image and slightly move one step forwards towards general intelligence.
